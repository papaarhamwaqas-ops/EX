## Style Guidelines:

- Primary element color (buttons, icons, highlights): A vibrant, academic golden-yellow that signifies energy and tech-driven innovation (RGB hex: #F9D527).
- Background color: A subtle, warm off-white, providing a clean and approachable canvas that harmonizes with the primary yellow while maintaining white dominance (RGB hex: #FCFAF7).
- Contrast and Text color: A dark charcoal, almost black, used for main typography, navigation, and other contrasting elements, ensuring high readability and a professional aesthetic (RGB hex: #333333).
- Unified typography using 'Inter' (sans-serif) for all text elements. This choice provides a modern, neutral, and highly readable look suitable for an academic and tech-driven platform.
- Utilize a consistent set of clean, minimalist line or filled icons that subtly reference academic concepts, ensuring a professional and contemporary interface design.
- Implement a modular and spacious layout characterized by smooth spacing, soft shadows, and rounded corners for all UI components and cards, fostering a friendly yet professional 'startup-like' feel.
- Incorporate subtle and efficient UI animations for interactions such as button presses, card transitions, and form submissions, enhancing responsiveness and user engagement without distraction.
